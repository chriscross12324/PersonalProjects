## [Spectrum [In Development]](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chris-coulthard_community-mobile-desktop-activity-6861842760228585472-Mj-Z?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
###### Description
"A community driven app for recommending and sharing music". This projects takes all that I've learned from my past projects, and all that I am currently learning, and packages it into a single idea. The features I decided to forego in my previous projects for not fitting how I wanted them to, debut in this project. Simple ideas and concepts such as User Accounts aren't going to be just for liking people's comments, but will deeply integrate into other features that will really drive the "community" aspect of this project.

###### Technologies
  1) Android Studio   (IDE)
  2) Flutter          (Framework)
  3) Dart             (Language)
  4) Google Firebase  (Database)
  5) Spotify API
  6) Apple Music API
  7) [More technologies will be added throughout development]

###### Goals
  1) Further my skills with the __Flutter__ framework and __Dart__ programming language.
  2) Design and Create a beautiful Mobile application keeping design, functionality, and accessibility main priorities.
  3) Develop a frictionless user experience that users want to experience rather than feel forced to use.
  4) Expand my skills in Database management and design, ensuring scalability and efficiency.
  5) Learn how to use Web API Endpoints.
  6) Bring together different communities and cultures into one place through the most shared hobbie... Music!

## [Pebble](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simple.chris.pebble)
###### Description
"Whether you are looking at colours for your next project or just like looking at them, Pebble has all the gradients for you!". This project was my first taste of networking and connecting client applications to a central server. For my second project I wanted to take the basics that I learned from my first project, continue my learning, and to connect people around the world. I wanted to forego user accounts and any advanced user features such as comments and likes, and to focus on creating a platform where people can anonoymously create and share their colourful creations with others that could then use those colours for their own projects.

###### Technologies
  1) Android Studio
  2) Java & Kotlin
  3) XML
  4) Google Firebase

###### Goals
  1) Expand on my understanding of programming concepts
  2) Refine personal UI/UX guidlines
  3) Connect to external databases to sync data among clients
  4) Utilize animations to improve fluidity

###### Year Began

## [Simple Rock Paper Scissors](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simplegames.chris.rockpaperscissors)
###### Description
"The classic 'Rock Paper Scissors' game has been brought to Android". A simple project that taught me the basics of programming (if/else, for/while loops, functions, random numbers, User Interface Implementation, etc.). The urge to create my own app originated from me looking at apps I used daily, and how I wanted to tweak aspects of them to my own liking, creating my own app let me do that; It also sparked a passion for creating, that would soon become my future career.

###### Technologies
  1) Android Studio
  2) Java
  3) XML

###### Goals
  1) Learn the fundamentals of programming (if/else, switch, rand, delay, etc.)
  2) Develop very basic User Interface & User Experience skills
  3) Create a simple game that anyone can play and understand

###### Year Began
